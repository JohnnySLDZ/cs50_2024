-If songs.db contains the top 100 songs of one listener from 2018, how would you characterize their audio aura?

--I would average the energy, valence, and danceability from this person's top 100 songs and then assign characteristics to their aura based on the results of
these averages.

-Hypothesize about why the way youâ€™ve calculated this aura might not be very representative of the listener. What better ways of calculating this aura would you propose?

--I don't think that looking only at the averages of these three characteristics of a song can define correctly the audio aura of a person, i would look also at the
genres of each song and the frequency the person has listened each one to have a bigger and more realistic view of this person's audio aura.
